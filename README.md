** The Aviation industry is a highly competitive market that requires
airlines to continuously meet the expectations of their customers.
When customers are satisfied with an airline’s services, they are
more likely to choose that airline for future travel, which can lead
to increased revenue and profitability for the airline. To achieve
this, airlines must deliver exceptional customer service both on and
off the plane.
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of a particular
airline in terms of customer service using Microsoft Power BI. The
airline sought a detailed data analysis to assess its performance in
several key areas, including cleanliness ratings, baggage handling
ratings, seat comfort ratings, and overall customer satisfaction
evaluations.
The objective of this analysis is to provide the airline with a
comprehensive evaluation of their performance in these areas,
highlighting areas where they excel and identifying areas where
improvement is needed. By utilizing data-driven insights, this
project aims to help the airline enhance its overall customer
experience and maintain its competitive edge in the aviation
industry. **
